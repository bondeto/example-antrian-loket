// config.ts

// This file is a placeholder for backend configuration.
// In a full-stack application, you would put your API base URL here.
// Example:
// export const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
//   ? 'http://localhost:3001/api' // Your local backend server
//   : 'https://your-production-api.com/api'; // Your deployed backend API

// For now, as this is a frontend-only prototype, this is not actively used.
export const API_BASE_URL = '/api'; // A common convention

// You might also include other environment-specific settings here.
export const REPORTING_FEATURE_ENABLED = true; // Example flag
